# Event Scheduler - iOS App
This was developed as a submission for an assignment. It is developed entirely in SwiftUI using Firebase for the backend.

## Features:
- Event Creation, Updation, and Deletion
- Color Coding Events
- Fully Functional Calendar
- A List view which lists the events of the selected day.
- A Timeline view that shows all the events graphically to get a bird's-eye view of the entire day's plan.
